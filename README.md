# Unmasking Systematic Variation in Single-cell Perturbation Response Prediction

This repository implements several single-cell perturbation response prediction methods under a unified pipeline. In this work, we demonstrate that existing single-cell perturbation datasets are often influenced by systematic variation (_i.e._, systematic differences between perturbed and control cells), which may arise as a result of selection biases and confounding factors. We study to what extent perturbation response prediction methods can generalize beyond these systematic effects. We also show that existing reference-based metrics are susceptible to systematic variation and demonstrate that predicting transcriptional outcomes of unseen genetic perturbations is remarkably hard. For more details, please check out our paper.

#### Methods
Currently, we support the following methods:
* CPA (`cpa`)
* GEARS (`gears`)
* scGPT (`scgpt`)

We implemented the following two non-parametric baselines:
* Non-control mean (`nonctl-mean`)
* Matching mean (`matching-mean`)

To run a method, execute the following command:
```
python src/run_METHOD.py --dataset DATASET (--finetune --seed SEED --device DEVICE --epochs EPOCHS)
```
This will train the method and store the test predictions for a given train/test split (split controlled by the random seed). The script `run_all.sh` executes all baselines for every dataset. We welcome contributions implementing additional methods.

#### Datasets
Currently, we support the following datasets:
* Dixit (2016)
* Adamson (2016)
* Norman (2019)
* Replogle RPE1 (2022)
* Replogle K562 (2022)

#### Evaluation

The notebooks `analysis/benchmark_*.ipynb` evaluate perturbation response prediction performance on different datasets. We load the predictions of different methods for a given dataset and multiple train/test splits. We then compute evaluation metrics based on these predictions.

## Environment
We recommend using Python >=3.10. The file `env/requirements.txt` contains the library versions of our environment. We used a separate environment for running scGPT (because of incompatibility issues with CPA/GEARS), which can be created by `bash env/scgpt_env.sh`.
